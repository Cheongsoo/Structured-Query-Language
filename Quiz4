1)Pull a list of customer ids with the customer’s full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. 
Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE.

SELECT CustomerId,
FirstName ||' '|| LastName AS Fullname,
Address,
UPPER(City ||' '|| Country) AS "City and Country"
FROM Customers

2)Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letter of the employee’s first name with the first 2 letters of the employee’s last name. 
Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.

SELECT FirstName,
LastName,
LOWER(SUBSTR(FirstName,1,4)) || LOWER(SUBSTR(LastName,1,2)) 
AS "employee userid"
FROM Employees
ORDER BY FirstName ASC

3)Show a list of employees who have worked for the company for 15 or more years using the current date function. 
Sort by lastname ascending.

SELECT LastName,
HireDate,
DATE('now') - HireDate AS Worked
FROM Employees
WHERE Worked >= 15
ORDER BY LastName ASC

4)Find the cities with the most customers and rank in descending order.

SELECT City,
       COUNT(CustomerId) AS Customer
FROM Customers
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY Customer DESC

5)Create a new customer invoice id by combining a customer’s invoice id with their first and last name 
while ordering your query in the following order: firstname, lastname, and invoiceID.

SELECT C.FirstName,
C.LastName,
I.InvoiceId,
C.FirstName || C.LastName || I.InvoiceID AS "customer's invoice id"
FROM Customers C INNER JOIN Invoices I
ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerID
WHERE "customer's invoice id" LIKE 'AstridGruber%'
